# Pathways: Visual Graph Builder

Pathways is a React + TypeScript web application that empowers users to create
and visualize connected graphs of data in an intuitive and visually appealing
manner.

## Features

- **Node Creation**: Create nodes to represent data points.
- **Graph Connections**: Draw connections between nodes in any of the 8 cardinal
  directions.
- **Node Customization**: Choose node sizes to represent different types of
  relationships.
- **Color Options**: Select from 8 standard colors to enhance graph aesthetics.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Save graphs for later use.
  - Import and share graphs with others.

## Example Use Case

Imagine creating a graph to represent the timeline of video game console
history:

- Nodes for each generation (e.g., Generation 1, Generation 2, etc.).
- Connections to consoles within each generation.
- Additional nodes for popular games, sales numbers, and manufacturers.

Pathways makes it easy to visually organize and explore such data.
